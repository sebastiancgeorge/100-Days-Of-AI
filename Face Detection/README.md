# 👁️ Day 6 – Real-time Face Detection using Mediapipe + OpenCV

This is part of my **#100DaysOfAI** challenge.  
On **Day 6**, I built a real-time face detection app using **Mediapipe** (by Google) and **OpenCV**. It detects faces live from the webcam and draws bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## 🎯 Goal

Build a lightweight, real-time face detection system using AI that works entirely offline.
