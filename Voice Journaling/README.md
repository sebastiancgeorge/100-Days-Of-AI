#  Day 5 – AI-Powered Voice Diary (Whisper + Tkinter)

Welcome to **Day 5** of my **#100DaysOfAI** challenge!  
Today, I built a simple **Voice Diary App** that lets you record voice notes, transcribe them offline using **Whisper**, and save them as text files — all in a clean desktop GUI.

---

##  Goal

Turn your daily voice thoughts into text using Whisper’s offline speech recognition, and save them as diary entries.
